Hey. So, this is meant for my Django tutorial, which you can find at www.andymboyle.com. Just some models, views and templates for setting up a basic Django app to track fires. Let me know if I did anything wrong, because, you know, I may have. Thanks to Derek Willis, Jeff Larson and Michael Strickland for helping me with some bits.

Oh, and this is just the first iteration. I plan on making Person a separate app, and perhaps fixing how that whole Title, Experience, etc., stuff works.
